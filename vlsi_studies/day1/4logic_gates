Logic Gates

Concepts

Logic gates are the basic building blocks of digital circuits.
They perform logical operations on one or more binary inputs to produce a single output.

Basic Gates

| Gate | Symbol | Expression  |     Truth Table        |
|------|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| AND  |    ·   | Y = A · B   | 00→0, 01→0, 10→0, 11→1 |
| OR   |    +   | Y = A + B   | 00→0, 01→1, 10→1, 11→1 |
| NOT  |    —   | Y = A  '    | 0→1, 1→0               |

Universal Gates

| Gate | Expression  |             Notes                    |
|------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| NAND |Y = (A · B)' | Universal gate — can form all others |
| NOR  |Y = (A + B)' | Universal gate — can form all others |

Example:  
NAND can act as NOT → (A·A)’ = A’

Derived Gates

| Gate |      Expression    |           Function           |
|------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| XOR  | A ⊕ B = A’B + AB’ | Output 1 when inputs differ  |
| XNOR | A ⊙ B = AB + A’B’ | Output 1 when inputs are same|

Realization using NAND / NOR only

Example:  
F = A + BC  
→ NAND realization:  
F = ((A’)·(B’ + C’))’  

These conversions are essential in CMOS/VLSI design since NAND and NOR are easiest to fabricate using MOS transistors.
